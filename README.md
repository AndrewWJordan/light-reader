# LightReader

LightReader is a Lighthouse audit utility that assists you with extracting failed audits from any number of Lighthouse JSON files.  

In the future, reports will be generated via Lighthouse and stored in the reports/
 directory.  The /results page will kickoff LightReader's process of looping through
 each report and extracting the report's failed audits.  It will then display them
 on the /results page for your review.  

 LightReader will also provide the ability to kickoff another audit of that page right
  from the same /results page, thus allowing you to confirm the fix.  

This is a work-in-progress. You will need Node and NPM installed.
